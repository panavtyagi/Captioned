After I finished writing the book So Sad Today, I still felt compelled to explore the intersection between love and infatuation, and love as a drug. I was on the beach in Venice reading a book called The Professor  The Siren about a man who had a love affair with a mermaid  twitter.comWomensPrizest atus
I realized that nothing embodies the intoxication of a love that cannot be like the relationship between human and mermaid. But why was it always an older man and a younger mermaid? What about an older woman and a younger man?
Venice could easily be ancient Greece. My merman Theo and my protagonist Lucy were born to me that day on the beach
As a poet I always thought it was weird  annoying when novelists referred to their characters as their babies or friends or like real people. Alas, I have become that annoying novelist.

i have no idea what this tweet means, but if one were to write a thesis on it, perhaps one may begin with the absurdity of our human attempts to control the uncontrollable via commodified spirituality footnote  the urban outfitters home section an activity i partake in often
another lens through which this tweet may be perceived is the dichotomy between universal absolutes birth, death and the vain attempt to defeat time by way of fostering ones own personal myth my writing, my hair, my pleather leggings via the narcissism of small differences
i smile a lot

pickles long lost cousin twice removed!
pickle was found in a supermarket parking lot, the same parking lot where i had a meltdown two years prior when i realized i would have to leave my life in new york for california for family health reasons if id only known i was moving to california so i could meet pickle...
pickle is not the type of dog who feels grateful to have been rescued. sometimes he wonders if he could have done even better. he loves me but he does not respect me. i respect this.
pickle rescued me. he requests a  cut of everything i eat as payback.
pickle flunked out of puppy school and has defeated two trainers. prozac and cbd do not work for him, but turkey breast and pretzels work great
pickle doesnt give a shit about how many followers i have on twitter
i'm always late for everything because i don't want to be anywhere

listen, just because it's the apocalypse doesn't mean i'm going to stop caring what people who don't matter think of me
i feel relaxed in a crisis because everyone is as anxious as i am all the time
due to personal reasons i will be ignoring you
it's okay to be lonely everyone is
dont forget to take your antidepressants
i love comforting myself with compulsive behaviors
oh great its another hour of my life
channeling a universe of anxiety into makeup
avoiding other people before it was cool
i feel like i should be better
my drug of choice is low selfesteem
i bet im doing the pandemic wrong
may i interest you in my passive aggressive attempts to be sort of okay
i wrote a short story thing sublevelmagazine.comissuesedgeba byatthemall   pic.twitter.comDxSGlptvP
recent studies confirm i hate everything
oops, it felt like selflove but it was selfdestruction
oh great another hour of my life
retweeting my own tweets for the dopamine
can you feel my anxiety through the internet
dont ask me how i am just say i love you
its suuuch a butlerian early works time rn
but i love setting myself up for disappointment
it's not you it's the mediocrity of reality
brb, eradicating my feelings
hello and welcome to my panic attack
sorry, i cant, im trying to escape the unrelenting yoke of time
just gonna offer you my dog, pickle, as mount rushmore pic.twitter.comuDKXQawSCy
gonna have to start social distancing on text too
im so sorry. you are such an awesome, funny, smart person with such a talent for books. will keep you in my thoughts tonight.
hey, if anyone is having panic attacks, i find keeping a panic diary soooo helpful. this is how i do mine. pic.twitter.comrNsegt
addendum to column  ran out of room lol pic.twitter.comsJKSRfrSXQ
compulsive selfanalysis that leads nowhere is my jam
oh great, now everyone is a scientist in addition to a political analyst
yeah sex is cool, but have you ever found the last can of chicken noodle soup at cvs while wearing a surgical mask
gonna cheer myself up by judging others for the same shit i do all the time
im scared...but im always scared
if you cant handle me in my panic attack then you dont deserve me in my general overall sense of doom
life is an annoying journey
"look on the bright side" "no"
this is the perfect level of human contact for me
the kids i didn't have are very thankful
reality has never been my favorite
i feel the symptoms a crush coming on
need a quarantine for my mind
do you want the real version or the fake version of how im doing
everything i know about panic attacks...now, in one handy episode podcasts.apple.comuspodcasteat
i have two modes anxious or asleep
i think my house is haunted but not by anything cool
these books are good pic.twitter.comknrdvWqhZF
cancelling my thoughts and feelings
don't cry because it's over, cry because you have addictive tendencies and want it to happen  more times
i always assume no one likes me and go from there
im fine till i google symptoms a memoir
is it cool if I channel my anxiety into being obsessed with you
if youre accomplishing shit please dont tell me, thx
many things are the worst
i consider it a good nights sleep if i only wake up nine times to pee
im not that good at being a person
organizing my trauma
im reading sunday w sadie dupuis, jenny zhang, and other good poets. tix are  and benefit the poets fund and project home twitter.comwaxninestatus
oh yeah also wax nine journal is taking poetry submissions. they pay  a poem httpwww. waxnine.comjournal
calm down  dont tell me what to do
oh ft. fuck
my life is totally destroying my life
judge me harder
staying strong is fucking annoying
i feel really bad that this feels really good
be your own apocalyptic nightmare
can we have a zoom meeting about why you rejected me
reading tonight with and other good poets eventbrite.comeisolationse ssionwithsadiedupuismelissabroderzachblackwoodtickets
coffee vs depression a losing battle
life is like a heavy annoying blanket
where do you live? trapped inside myself
wish i was asleep
my default setting is loser
tired but tired
sorry but i hate everything more than you do
opened my heart and then was like no
getting out of bed seems like a major accomplishment
my mind is a conspiracy against myself
i will not compare myself to strangers on the internet just kidding
sleeping all day speaks louder than words
resting existential crisis face
setting boundaries and not lovin it!
its rare when something isnt a piece of shit
i cannot heart another text
dont recommend me anything unless youre sylvia plath or a wolf
do i like you? no. do i need you to like me? yes.
its important to give up
virgo with scorpio moon and sag rising
polishing my anxiety
don't mind me I'm not really alive
letting go of negative thoughts seems like a fulltime job
looking forward to waking up to the inner voices that say im a piece of shit
tragedy  time  talking shit to imaginary people in the shower
my anxiety has been training for this for years
i wish i was a bagel with cream cheese
busy day of fighting my mind
what do you mean my thoughts are not an objective truth regarding the certainty that i am fucked
here let me just rip my heart out and give it to you
cant tell if people know they are full of shit or have no clue
heres flat fido with my dog pickle. flat fido has a much better attitude than pickle tbh media.blueq.comdataFileBlog FlatBlueQFlatFido.pdf   pic.twitter.comFVrKMDOU

if you need me ill be worrying about shit beyond my control
wish i could be deprogrammed to not be me
my mind is unquestionably trying to kill me today
when did being a narc become your favorite pastime
sorry, but i have more important shit to being doing like hating myself
this is a good tweet lets try this again...ahem
sorry, but i have more important shit to be doing like hating myself
ok i tweeted it again without the mistake for your retweeting purposes
ok gonna delete this thread because my anxiety is manifesting itself as a desire to control things that dont matter
like keeping my feed tidy
oh fuck, people seem to be relating to the misspelled tweet too, should i keep or delete
ok ill keep it because im a dopaminehungry sheep. goodnight and good luck!
i wouldnt say i actively hate myself, but more like i awaken each morning in a hot tub of selfhate from which i must then actively extricate myself
it's my body and i'll shame it if i want to
how do you be nice to yourself without thinking the niceness is a lie
so sad today
good morning and welcome to the terror of being alive
we love you
in these difficult times, never forget whats important deleting tweets is nothing to be ashamed of
i dont want to know how i feel
everyone is doing the best they can and its not great
that which does not kill you but makes you sleep all day
im a brand ambassador for low selfesteem
imagine being pregnant for nine months and then giving birth to a hamburger
your positive attitude hurts my feelings
i feel insecure. in other news, the world is round
you know what i love is being asleep
if you need me i'll be bracing for rejection
i only stay alive to post this meme every year my favorite meme a blessing to humanity
its important to be a loser
im basing my entire selfesteem on something but i forget what it is
forgave myself, but then punished myself for something else
thinking of what i can do to help others and making it about me
i want to sleep but my phone wants to be held
i need a new mind and a new body
hi, can you just tell me i'm acceptable
someone texted me today to tell me how good their life is
in isolation, but still feel like telling people to go away
so you think you can go a day without overthinking
stop peer pressuring me to know what i think, feel, or want
i have a headache from dealing with myself
these books are good pic.twitter.comtIFXczmhLs
i think its fine to not be strong
im doing great except for everything i dont wanna talk about because im in denial
hello, it is i, my own worst enemy
masturbating for a better world
life reminds me why i find life difficult
im cosplaying listening to you
in a complicated relationship with the amount of shit i have to do just to stay alive
obsessing about people i was over years ago
i always think everything bad is about me
you're damn right i'm compromising myself so people will like me
unworthiness is my safe space
youre really one of the prettiest people, i always think so
did i take my antidepressants today? the musical!
it's never too late to have a meltdown
hello stranger, would you mind if i base my entire sense of wellbeing on your opinion
gross i'm alive
where does it hurt? points to existence
tell me my vulnerability is the right kind
i always assume im totally fucked, just to be safe
"i'm ashamed to be alive" me flirting with someone
me im an introvert also me tells internet everything
tell the things i once enjoyed that i say hey
had a feeling and buried it in under a second
might be depressed
not destroying myself is a lot of work
when people say its going to be ok they dont realllly know
sometimes i think my selfesteem is getting better and then its like...
listen, its not my fault i want to sleep through my life
i handle rejection the oldfashioned way by hating myself
horoscope fucked that one up
now i see you as a human being and it's less painful than when i saw you as a magic creature but also less exciting
i think youre using the internet to hide from your life yeah, exactly
yeah no shit i'm trying too hard
youre damn right im taking the easy way out
that which does not kill you but makes you misinterpret every situation through a distorted lens of anxiety
if you need me ill be getting attached to emotionally unavailable people and hiding from the emotionally available ones
as long as its not used as a noun, we are safe
stay strong! be positive! or be weak and negative its fine
that which does not kill you but makes you numb out with romantic obsessions
am i going to get in trouble for being alive
being the best version of the most mediocre version of myself i can be
shit cant get worse shit gets worse
siri, how can i be a good person but without any discomfort on my part
what feelings should i kill tonight?
if i had a life i probably wouldnt want it
whispers during sex do you think im enough?
some people seem to accept being alive so easily
I've been awake five minutes and it's already too much
it's important to hate everything
being infatuated with you has been a real pleasure
trapped in my life
in a relationship with constant tiredness
dont obsess about it yeah ok thanks you fixed me
i feel like i should be better
i came, i saw, i got rejected
already feeling judged by the aliens
stop peer pressuring me to stay strong
if you need me i'll be visualizing the worst possible outcome
i cant wait to tell you about my suffering
well i'm getting uglier
do you control your fear or does your fear control you?! my fear controls me
not in the mood for a pandemic
i cant stop being me and its depressing
for fun i like to obsess about shit i cant control
help i cant stop thinking
in these uncertain times its a comfort to know i still dont love myself
i feel like evolution didnt work
look ma, no serotonin
phd in preparing for people to spontaneously stop liking me
i cant, im selfsabotaging
i dont know what anything is
still my top two people to fuck
my superpower is being cynical about everything yet easily fooled
if someone talks shit about everyone to you then theyre also talking shit about you to everyone dot edu
home is where the anxiety is
some people im bored, gonna watch tv me im bored, gonna attempt to resurrect the painful past as something impossibly beautiful
when people talk about selflove i feel like theyre joking
obsessing about moisturizer and death
crying about someone you got over already is an art
bad decisions are so exciting
stop not loving me
im not crying but im crying
losing my health insurance in the middle of a pandemic like a good american
my current crush is just a blob of hot people all blurring together
i hate that we had a connection
honestly cant deal with existing
i have a crush on  people, none of them real
ohhh, baby, i love the way you profit off a crisis in the name of empathy
gonna just stick to what im good at...hating myself
i dont want to live in a world whereactually i just dont want to live in a world
every day is very long
everything i'm truly attracted to will probably kill me dot org
i already have a bad feeling about my destiny
in my house you are
i'm not the most excited about being alive today
i like pics of me where you cant see my body or face

im thrilled to announce that i didnt do shit today
im immune to selfesteem
someone is screaming on my street and it might be me
"this is the last straw" me literally every day
i was fine for a second but then it went away
excited for my expectations to turn into resentments
cant sleep at night but great at it during the day
i can be pretty amazing at worrying about bullshit
panics over something dumb

any hot person i see in a zoom is my soulmate
the meaning of life is probably annoying
pretend you haven't forgotten about me
i feel overwhelmed and im not even doing anything
im starting to think that feelings are just going to keep happening
you should love me for me even though i totally don't
oh that? it's just my emptiness
just sitting here quietly thinking Im a loser
what i want what ill get
slower sadder less productive
when people talk about selflove i feel like its a conspiracy
i don't need to sleep forever just for  years
i keep meaning to be a different person
i like to pretend that if i dont want to have a feeling i can just not have it
not in the mood to be a living being
not getting out of bed is truth
studies show that everything sucks
behaving like an adult sounds really bad
im not lazy im depressed
am i supposed to, like, do stuff
finger me with a black latex glove in a global pandemic
i mean, fuck everything kind of
are we dead?
in the cruel light of day i am unfortunately still me

brb, figuring out how to live
im always kind of simultaneously annoyed and turned on
your "positive energy" scares the shit out of me
nothing good happens out of bed
hot people are causing me suffering
why are people always asking questions where they think i have a life?
for every half hour i spend talking to someone it takes me four to recover
want me to amplify question?

hi, im paranoid that everyone ive ever met spontaneously hates me, how are you?
i dont trust any of you
obsessive thinking just feels right
